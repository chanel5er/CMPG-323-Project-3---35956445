# CMPG-323-Project-3---35956445

This project aims to familiarise users with various design patterns and principles. The aim is to seperate controllers to ensure that any calculations and new instances is created seperately.
We will mainly make use of the repository design pattern where we seperate the code into repository classe and interfaces. We then inject the classes as needed. We will also ensure that we do not repeat code and that only code that is needed is there.
